                            The FSSAI Annual Return is a mandatory compliance requirement for food businesses holding an FSSAI license. It is a yearly report submitted to the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) that provides details about the food products manufactured, handled, imported, or sold during the financial year.
