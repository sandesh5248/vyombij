It organizes the logistics of e-waste collection, take-back programs, and reporting, helping producers meet their EPR targets without managing their own collection infrastructure."

                    "answer": "CPCB requires a minimum net worth of ₹10 Crore (as per the latest audited balance sheet) for entities applying for PRO authorization. This ensures PROs have adequate financial resources to manage large-scale e-waste collection operations."

However, the PRO must have sufficient operational capacity — collection points, transportation agreements, and recycler partnerships — to meet the combined EPR targets of all its registered producers."

                    "question": "What is the process for PRO authorization from CPCB?",
                    "answer": "The process involves submitting Form-4 on the CPCB portal with all required documents, CPCB review (typically 30 days), physical verification of operational capacity, and issuance of PRO authorization certificate valid for 5 years."
          },
          {
                    "question": "Can a recycler also be a PRO?",
                    "answer": "A single entity cannot simultaneously hold both e-waste recycler authorization and PRO authorization under the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2022 to avoid conflict of interest. Separate entities must be registered for these activities."
          },
          {
                    "question": "What is the validity and renewal period for PRO authorization?",
                    "answer": "PRO authorization is valid for 5 years from the date of issue. Renewal applications must be filed 60 days before expiry. The same documentation requirements and net worth criteria apply at the time of renewal."
          },
          {
                    "question": "Do producers still have EPR liability if they enroll with a PRO?",
                    "answer": "Yes. Producers remain ultimately liable for EPR compliance even if they engage a PRO. The PRO fulfills the EPR targets on the producer's behalf, but the compliance is tracked against the producer's EPR registration on the CPCB portal."
