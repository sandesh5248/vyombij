                            question: "Why is wastewater a major focus in Dairy ESDD?",
                            answer: "Dairy processing generates huge amounts of wastewater containing milk solids, detergents, and sanitizers. This effluent has extremely high Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) and fats. If discharged untreated, it destroys aquatic ecosystems. ESDD rigorously checks the capacity and effectiveness of the existing Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs)."

                            answer: "The dairy supply chain heavily relies on thousands of unorganized rural farmers. Social ESDD checks if procurement pricing is fair and transparent, if child labor is utilized at farm levels or collection centers, and if workers inside chilling plants receive adequate wages and protective gear against cold environments and cleaning chemicals."

                            answer: "Yes, this is a critical component. Dairy plants consume massive amounts of fresh water for cleaning and cooling. We verify if the facility possesses a valid No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) and if they are maintaining mandatory rainwater harvesting structures."

                            answer: "Boilers are essential for pasteurization and creating milk powder, but they are major polluters. The audit checks what fuels are used (coal, husk, gas), the height of the chimney stacks (as per Air Act norms), and whether required air pollution control devices (like scrubbers or bag filters) are installed and functioning."

                            question: "What happens if a dairy plant fails the ESDD audit?",
                            answer: "If major non-compliances are found (e.g., discharging untreated waste, expired CTOs), it generates 'red flags'. While this can stall pending investments or M&A deals, Corpbiz immediately formulates an Environmental & Social Action Plan (ESAP) detailing exactly how to fix these issues to regain compliance."

                            answer: "Absolutely. Before construction, an ESDD (often termed Environmental Impact Assessment depending on the scale) is required to secure the 'Consent to Establish' (CTE) from the State Pollution Control Board. It plots out how the new facility will manage its water footprint, waste, and community impact."

                            answer: "The audit evaluates the disposal of solid waste including ETP sludge (which can be used as manure if treated properly), boiler ash, and the massive amounts of plastic packaging waste (pouches/bottles). We check compliance with Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) norms for plastic waste."

                            answer: "Yes, significantly. Foreign institutional investors and Impact Funds strictly require alignment with global ESG standards (like IFC Performance Standards). A clean, independent ESDD report proves your operations are sustainable, opening doors to premium global capital."
