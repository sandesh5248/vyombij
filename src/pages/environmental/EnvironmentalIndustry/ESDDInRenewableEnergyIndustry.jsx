                            question: "Why does a 'Green' project like solar or wind need Environmental Due Diligence?",
                            answer: "While the energy generated is clean, the infrastructure process isn't entirely harmless. Large solar/wind farms require massive land acquisition, water for cleaning panels, and involve waste generation (like broken panels or blades). ESDD ensures the negative impacts of construction and operation are minimized and managed."

Most international banks mandate compliance with these standards (covering aspects like labor rights, pollution prevention, and biodiversity conservation) before approving loans."

                            answer: "Social due diligence thoroughly audits how land was acquired. It checks if local communities were fairly compensated, if any indigenous groups were displaced against legal protocols, and if a proper grievance redressal mechanism exists. It prevents legal disputes that could paralyze the project."

This is a legally and technically sound roadmap outlining exactly what the project developer must do, the timeline, and the estimated cost to achieve full regulatory compliance."
