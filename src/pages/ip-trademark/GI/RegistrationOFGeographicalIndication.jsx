                            Have You Heard About the Registration of Geographical Indication? The Registration of Geographical Indication is a legal process that protects products originating from a specific geographical region and possessing unique qualities, reputation, or characteristics linked to that origin.
                        </p>
                        <p className="text-[17px] text-slate-600 leading-relaxed font-medium mb-6">
                            Governed by the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act 1999, this registration ensures exclusive rights for authorized users and prevents unauthorized use of the registered product name. It also supports the local economy by promoting goods specific to the region and preserving traditional knowledge.

                            A Geographical Indication (GI) is a name or sign used on products that originate from a specific geographical location and have qualities, characteristics, or a reputation that are directly linked to that place of origin. The Government of India Registry for GI registration serves two main purposes: it protects against counterfeiting and misleading trade practices, and it strikes a balance between trademark protection and GI protection.
