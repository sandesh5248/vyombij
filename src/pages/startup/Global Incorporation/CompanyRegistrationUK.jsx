                            UK company registration is the legal process of incorporating a business with Companies House, the official registrar of companies in the United Kingdom. Once incorporated, your company becomes a separate legal entity capable of operating internationally, opening business bank accounts, entering contracts, and building credibility in global markets.
                        </p>

                            Many entrepreneurs choose the UK as a business destination because of its business-friendly regulations, strong financial ecosystem, and global credibility. The most common business structure is the Private Limited Company (Ltd), which offers limited liability protection and operational flexibility.
