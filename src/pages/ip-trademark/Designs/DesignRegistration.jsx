                            Design registration is a legal process that provides intellectual property rights protection to the aesthetic aspect of a product’s design. It provides exclusive rights for 10 years, further extended for a limited period of 5 years through renewal.

                            The registration and protection of industrial designs in India are governed by the Designs Act, 2000, and the Designs Rules, 2001. These laws help protect the new and original features of a design, such as shape, configuration, surface, pattern, ornaments, and composition of lines or colours that apply to articles in a finished state.
