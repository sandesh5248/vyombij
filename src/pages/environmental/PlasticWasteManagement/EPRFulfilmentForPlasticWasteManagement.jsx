        { question: "What is EPR fulfilment in plastic waste management?", answer: "EPR fulfilment refers to the process by which producers, importers, and brand owners (PIBOs) meet their annual plastic packaging collection, recycling, and use-of-recycled-content (URV) targets as mandated by the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016. Fulfilment can be achieved through physical waste collection + PWP tie-ups, or by purchasing EPR credits from registered plastic waste processors on the CPCB portal." },
        { question: "Why is EPR fulfilment important for plastic waste?", answer: "Non-fulfilment of EPR targets attracts Environmental Compensation (EC) at ₹32.13/kg for recycling shortfall (FY 2023-24). CPCB publishes a list of non-compliant PIBOs annually, damaging brand reputation. Persistent non-fulfilment can lead to product bans, operations suspension, and public interest litigation by the environment ministry." },
        { question: "How do PIBOs fulfil their plastic EPR targets?", answer: "PIBOs can fulfil EPR targets through: (1) Setting up their own plastic waste collection networks; (2) Engaging authorized PWPs for processing; (3) Partnering with local bodies, gram panchayats, or third-party waste managers; (4) Purchasing EPR certificates/credits from registered PWPs on the CPCB centralized portal." },
        { question: "What is the annual return deadline for plastic waste EPR?", answer: "PIBOs must file annual returns by June 30 of the next financial year on the CPCB portal. PWPs must file annual returns by June 30 as well (some categories by April 30), providing category-wise and state-wise plastic waste processing data. Late filing attracts Environmental Compensation." },
        { question: "What are the 7 categories of plastic under plastic waste management?", answer: "The PWM Rules 2016 define 7 categories: (1) PET - Polyethylene Terephthalate, (2) HDPE - High Density Polyethylene, (3) PVC - Polyvinyl Chloride, (4) LDPE - Low Density Polyethylene, (5) PP - Polypropylene, (6) PS - Polystyrene resins, (7) Multi-materials (ABS, poly-phenylene oxide, polycarbonate, PBT)." },
        { question: "What penalties apply for non-fulfilment of EPR obligations?", answer: "Penalties include: Environmental Compensation at ₹32.13/kg recycling shortfall; product ban orders; publication of non-compliant PIBOs on CPCB website; suspension of EPR registration; and potential criminal action under the Environment Protection Act 1986 for willful non-compliance." },
        { question: "Can Corpbiz manage EPR target fulfilment for our company?", answer: "Yes. Corpbiz offers a full-service EPR target fulfilment retainer that covers: EPR target calculation, PWP tie-ups or credit procurement, CPCB portal management, annual return filing, EC deposit (if needed), and year-round compliance monitoring — so you never face penalties or missing deadlines." }
