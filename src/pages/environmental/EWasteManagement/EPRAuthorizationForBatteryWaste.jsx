                            "EPR for battery waste refers to a producer's extended producer responsibility for managing battery waste in a way that safeguards both the environment and human health. The Battery Waste Management Rules were introduced by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) in 2022.",
                            "The Battery Waste Management Rules impose duties on producers through EPR, requiring that all used batteries be collected and sent for refurbishment or recycling. These rules apply to all types of batteries including electric vehicle batteries, portable batteries, industrial batteries, and automotive batteries.",
                            "Any producer, importer, or brand owner who puts batteries on the Indian market must register on the CPCB EPR portal and obtain EPR authorization. Producers may hire recyclers or refurbishers to fulfill the EPR obligation.",
                            "The CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board) is the central authority for granting EPR authorizations for battery waste. Producers operating in more than two states must obtain authorization from CPCB, while those limited to 1-2 states may register with the respective SPCB/PCC."
