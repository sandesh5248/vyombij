                            EIA is usually required for Schedule I projects as per EIA Notification, 2006. EIA is a procedure that evaluates a proposed or existing project's environmental implications before its development. It assesses the environmental impacts of a planned project or development activity, considering the positive-negative and inter-related socioeconomic, cultural, and human-health aspects. Environment Impact Assessment is used to estimate the environmental implications of a project during the planning stage to take necessary actions to mitigate the negative impacts. The Government of India makes EIA mandatory for Environment Clearance for over 39 listed projects in the schedule as per EIA Notification 2006.

                            Environmental Auditing procedure is a practical management tool that helps an industry or organisation verify compliance with environmental norms or requirements, evaluate the effectiveness of the environmental management system, assess risks, and identify and correct environmental hazards. There have been several cases in India where the Environmental Audit has helped reduce risks and pollution from the project sector.

                            The WCP uses sustainable and scientific management of the area's natural wealth to provide safeguarding measures and wildlife protection from unsavoury elements and carry out developmental activities without affecting these resources. Therefore, biodiversity conservation and management plans are formulated in a way that can provide need-based, site-specific, and participatory eco-development inputs to local stakeholders for reducing their resource dependency on forests and for eliciting their support towards conservation in the area. Indian Government has initiated projects for wildlife conservation to check human encroachment. Choose VyomBiz for transparent Wildlife Conservation Planning and streamline your Environment Clearance and other approval processes for your project.

                        <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed font-medium">
                            Half-Yearly Environmental Compliance Reports are routinely delivered by the first of June and the first of December of each year to the regional office of the MoEF&CC and the other concerned regulatory authorities. The State Environment Impact Assessment Authority may issue a show-cause notice to project proponents who are found to violate the restrictions. The State authorities also have the power to suspend environmental clearances or revoke them in the event of infractions. To comply with such strict environmental legislations and applicable post-compliance and maintain business accreditation, get your half-yearly environmental compliance report prepared with VyomBiz
