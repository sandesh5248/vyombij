            question: "Is this identical to the previous OHSAS 18001?",
            answer: "No, while related, ISO 45001 fully replaces OHSAS 18001 and is designed to integrate heavily with other global standards like ISO 9001 and ISO 14001, providing a robust overall management systemic framework."

            question: "Does it guarantee zero absolutely operating accidents?",

        {
            question: "How often does surveillance occur?",
