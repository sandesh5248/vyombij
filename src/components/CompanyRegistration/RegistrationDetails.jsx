                            A private limited company is a famous business structure in India due to its distinct characteristic features. It is a separate legal entity, allowing limited liability protection to its shareholders and protecting their personal assets from business debts. Governed by the Companies Act 2013, a private limited company can be registered with a minimum of two shareholders and a maximum number of 200 shareholders.                        </p>
                        <p className="text-[17px] text-slate-600 leading-relaxed font-medium mb-6">
                            This type is suited for businesses that aim to raise funds for operations in the long run. It allows shareholders to transfer their shares by the company's Articles of Association (AOA) rules. However, unlike public limited companies, private limited companies cannot offer shares to the general public or trade them on the stock exchange. These companies must comply with regulations, including audits, annual filings and corporate governance norms. This structure is ideal for small and medium enterprises as it offers management flexibility and a specific degree of financial privacy.                        </p>

It boosts the organization's credibility, making it easier to gain the trust of the customers, suppliers and investors. It also opens the gateway to secure funding and facilitates protecting intellectual property rights. Company registration in India guarantees perpetual succession, enabling the business to operate beyond the founders' participation. Registering a business is a step that gives the company a formal and legal standing, helps in its expansion and provides financial stability."
