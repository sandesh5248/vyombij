                            "Plastic waste disposal has become a significant challenge in India, with the rapid increase in disposable plastic production outpacing the country's waste management capacity. Plastic pollution is especially severe in developing nations like India, where waste collection systems are often inefficient.",
                            "To address this issue, the Indian government introduced plastic waste authorization under the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016. As per these rules, any business or entity involved in the collection, storage, transportation, processing, or recycling of plastic waste is required to obtain an authorization certificate from the designated authorities to operate legally.",
