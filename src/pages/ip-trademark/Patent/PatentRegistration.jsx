                            Patent registration in India grants inventors' exclusive rights, preventing others from making, using, or selling their inventions without authorization or permission. The procedure for registration of a patent begins with a patent search to determine whether the invention is new and innovative. After this, an application containing detailed technical specifications is filed with the Indian Patent Office.
                        </p>
                        <p className="text-[17px] text-slate-600 leading-relaxed font-medium mb-6">
                            After examination and publication, and if no objections or oppositions arise, the patent is granted by the authority. In India, a patent remains valid for 20 years from the date of filing. Patent registration protects innovative ideas and allows inventors to benefit commercially from their inventions.
