                            "India is the world's second-largest producer of food next to China and has the potential to be the biggest. The Indian food processing industry is split into six main categories: Fisheries, Dairy, fruits & vegetables processing, Grain processing, Meat & poultry processing, and Consumer foods. Recent shifts have moved production and consumption from grains to high-value commodities like processed food products.",
                            "ESDD is crucial for identifying potential environmental and social (E&S) risks and liabilities associated with a specific transaction or investment. It assesses a project's compliance with national legal requirements as well as international good practice standards. For agricultural businesses, ESDD evaluates both social impact (supplier relationships) and environmental impact (sustainable practices) to ensure long-term productivity and supply security.",

Factors such as outdated technology in small-scale units and high-cost finance continue to affect the processing extent in India."
