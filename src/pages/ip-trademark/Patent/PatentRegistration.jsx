                            Patent registration in India grants inventors' exclusive rights, preventing others from making, using, or selling their inventions without authorization or permission. The procedure for registration of a patent begins with a search to confirm whether the invention is unique and innovative. The next step involves filing an application with detailed specifications with the Indian Patent Office.

                            Once the review and publication are over, and if no objections or oppositions are raised, the patent and registration are granted. The validity of a patent in India is 20 years. Patent registration safeguards innovations, allowing inventors to benefit from their inventions commercially.
