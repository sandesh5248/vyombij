                            Examining a patent or group of patents to support your business or company goals is the process of conducting patent due diligence. Depending on the circumstances that lead to the need for diligence, there are numerous ways in which due diligence for patents can be performed.

                            Finding out whether your patents are being violated by others or whether they can be made profitable through licensing or divestiture might be offensive. As a first step to enforcing your patents, offensive diligence may entail investigating the products of other businesses to see if any of them infringe.

                        <p className="text-[17px] text-slate-600 leading-relaxed font-medium mb-6">
                            The defensive aspect of patent due diligence includes determining if you have the freedom to operate in your upcoming business venture and determining whether you are infringing on others' patents.
