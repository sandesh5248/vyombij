                    "question": "What are the tyre EPR targets for 2024–25?",
                    "answer": "For FY 2024–25, tyre manufacturers must collect 70% of tyres manufactured/imported in FY 2022–23. From FY 2025–26 onwards, the target is 100% of tyres manufactured/imported 2 years prior."

                    "answer": "Yes. Surplus physical collection beyond the current year's target can be converted into EPR credits and carried forward to offset future year targets. This can help producers who exceed targets in good years to offset potential shortfalls in lean years."
          },
          {
                    "question": "What happens if EPR targets are missed?",
                    "answer": "CPCB levies Environmental Compensation (EC) for shortfall in EPR targets. EC rates are notified annually and are significantly higher than the cost of meeting targets through credits or physical collection. Repeated shortfall can lead to authorization suspension."
          },
          {

Our 300+ recycler network ensures target fulfilment across all categories."
