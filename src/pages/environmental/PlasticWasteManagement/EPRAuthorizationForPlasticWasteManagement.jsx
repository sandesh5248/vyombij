        { question: "What is Plastic Waste EPR Registration?", answer: "EPR registration for plastic waste is a mandatory environmental compliance requirement for producers, importers, brand owners, and plastic waste processors seeking registration with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). It ensures accountability for managing plastic packaging waste by requiring businesses to meet recycling, reuse, or end-of-life disposal targets, promoting a circular economy and reducing environmental pollution." },
        { question: "What is the applicability of EPR in plastic waste management?", answer: "EPR applies to all producers, importers, and brand owners (PIBOs) who place plastic packaging in the Indian market. This includes rigid plastic, flexible plastic, multi-layer plastic, and compostable plastic packaging across all categories (I to IV) as defined under the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016 (amended 2022)." },
        { question: "What are the categories of plastic packaging under EPR?", answer: "Category I covers rigid plastic packaging (PET bottles, containers). Category II covers single-layer flexible plastic. Category III covers multi-layered/composite plastic packaging with one or more non-plastic layers. Category IV covers compostable plastic packaging meeting standards for biological degradation." },
        { question: "What entities are required for CPCB EPR plastic waste management registration?", answer: "Producers, importers, brand owners, sellers and importers of raw materials, manufacturers of raw materials, MSMEs, plastic waste processors (recyclers, waste-to-energy, waste-to-oil, industrial composting firms), and online platforms/supermarket chains operating in more than two states." },
        { question: "How much must be paid in application fees for plastic waste EPR registration?", answer: "Registration fees on the CPCB EPR portal are based on the quantity of plastic packaging. The fees range from ₹2,000 to ₹25,000 depending on annual plastic usage volume. The CPCB portal specifies the fee slab applicable to each PIBO at the time of application." },
        { question: "Why is EPR registration required for plastic packaging?", answer: "EPR registration is legally mandatory under the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016. Non-compliance can attract penalties up to ₹50 lakh, product bans, and regulatory action. EPR also demonstrates environmental commitment, enhancing brand reputation and consumer trust among the 70%+ consumers who prefer compliant brands." },
        { question: "What is the difference between EPR for e-waste and EPR for plastic waste?", answer: "Plastic EPR covers producers/importers of plastic packaging under PWM Rules 2016. E-waste EPR covers producers/importers of electrical and electronic equipment under E-Waste Rules 2022. Both are managed through separate CPCB portals with different target types, reporting formats, and certificate-issuing mechanisms." }
