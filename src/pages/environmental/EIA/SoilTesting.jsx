                            answer: "Soil sampling is the actual physical procedure of collecting earth/dirt using probes and sending the sample to a laboratory. Soil testing is the subsequent chemical/physical analysis performed directly by the lab on that sample."

                            answer: "It is best conducted right after harvesting or before the onset of the crop season. For croplands, sampling in the fall is ideal, while summer ending is preferable for perennial crops."
