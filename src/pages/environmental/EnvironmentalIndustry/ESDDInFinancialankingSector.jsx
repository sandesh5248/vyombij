                            question: "Why is ESDD important for banks and financial institutions?",
                            answer: "ESDD is crucial for banks because it prevents direct credit risks associated with borrowers whose projects might be stalled due to environmental non-compliance. It also protects the bank from reputational damage, ensures compliance with RBI's sustainable finance guidelines, and enables access to global green financing pools."

                            answer: "Common environmental risks include lending to high-polluting industries facing regulatory closure, real estate projects lacking environmental clearances, businesses vulnerable to physical climate risks (e.g., coastal facilities prone to flooding), and assets that may become 'stranded' due to the transition to a low-carbon economy."

                            answer: "ESDD helps reduce NPAs by identifying projects that are likely to fail due to environmental violations, social protests, or inability to secure regulatory permits. By avoiding loans to such high-risk projects, banks protect their capital and ensure stable repayment schedules from compliant borrowers."

They have issued consultation papers on sustainable finance and are moving towards mandating standardized climate risk disclosures and ESDD integration in credit appraisals."

                            answer: "An ESG-linked loan (or sustainability-linked loan) is a financing instrument where the loan terms, such as the interest rate, are directly tied to the borrower's performance against pre-determined Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) targets. If the borrower meets the targets, they receive a financial incentive (lower rate)."

                            answer: "While it introduces an additional assessment layer, a well-integrated ESDD framework utilizing technology and clear guidelines should not significantly slow down approvals. Corpbiz helps banks streamline this by categorizing loans into risk tiers (low, medium, high), focusing deep ESDD resources only on the high-risk proposals."
