                    faqs={[
                        { question: "What are the sustainability issues in the sugar industry?", answer: "Various sustainability issues exist in the sugar industry. Sugar mills produce a lot of wastewater, solid waste, and emissions that adversely impact the environment. The massive quantities of sludge discharged from mills decompose in freshwater bodies and absorb the oxygen, leading to fish kills. Other concerns include water consumption, pesticide use, greenhouse gas emissions, and social impacts on farming communities." },
                        { question: "What are the major challenges faced by the sugar industry in India?", answer: "Major challenges include extensive regulation from sugarcane procurement to sale, fragmented market structure with both organised and unorganised stakeholders, climatic risks due to erratic weather patterns, increasing production costs outpacing sugar prices, and complex environmental compliance requirements involving wastewater and solid waste management." },
                        { question: "Why is ESDD important for the sugar industry?", answer: "ESDD is important for the sugar industry because the sector is exposed to significant environmental risks (emissions, wastewater, waste generation) and social risks (labour practices, farmer livelihoods, community impacts). ESDD helps identify and mitigate these risks, ensures regulatory compliance, attracts ESG-conscious investors, and supports sustainable business growth." },
                        { question: "How can we make the sugar industry eco-friendly?", answer: "The sugar industry can be made eco-friendly by adopting zero liquid discharge systems, converting bagasse and press mud into biogas and compost, implementing energy efficiency measures in mills, using sustainable agricultural practices to reduce pesticide and fertiliser use, and conducting regular environmental audits." },
                        { question: "What are the major problems of the sugar industry?", answer: "Major problems include sugarcane price regulation and market volatility, high water consumption in processing, generation of large quantities of wastewater and solid waste, greenhouse gas emissions, complex regulatory compliance from farm to market, and climatic risks affecting sugarcane cultivation and yield." },
                        { question: "What are the key challenges in conducting ESDD in the sugar industry?", answer: "Key challenges include navigating extensive government regulations, managing fragmented supply chains, addressing climatic risks, conducting comprehensive social impact assessments for large farming communities, managing environmental risks from wastewater and emissions, and staying updated with evolving regulatory frameworks." },
                        { question: "How do you conduct an ESDD?", answer: "ESDD is conducted by reviewing project information, assessing national and state legal requirements, conducting site visits and environmental sampling, undertaking institutional assessments, performing stakeholder consultations, carrying out activity-wise environmental and social screenings, identifying risks and mitigation measures, and preparing comprehensive ESDD reports." },
                        { question: "What is an environmental and social due diligence report?", answer: "An ESDD report is a comprehensive document that summarises the findings of an environmental and social assessment, including identified risks and impacts, proposed mitigation measures, a monitoring and management plan, and recommendations for ensuring compliance with applicable standards." }
