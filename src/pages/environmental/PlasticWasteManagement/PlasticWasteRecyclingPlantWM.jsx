    const faqs = [
        { question: "What is the cost of a plastic waste recycling plant setup in India?", answer: "The cost of setting up a plastic waste recycling plant in India varies based on the plant capacity and technology. A small-scale plant (1-2 MT/day) may require an investment of ₹25-50 lakh, while a medium-scale facility (5 MT/day) can cost ₹1-3 crore including machinery, land development, and pollution control equipment." },
        { question: "Is a plastic waste recycling plant setup profitable?", answer: "Yes, it is highly profitable. Licensed plastic waste recyclers can earn revenue from selling recycled pellets/granules to manufacturers, generating and selling EPR credits to PIBOs on the CPCB portal, and securing contracts with large brands and municipalities. The ROI is typically achieved within 2-3 years for a well-managed operation." },
        { question: "What licenses are required for plastic waste recycling plant setup?", answer: "Required licenses include: Company Incorporation Certificate, GST Registration, No Objection Authorization from SPCB/PCC (Consent to Establish and Consent to Operate), Factory License under the Factories Act 1948, and IEC Code (for importers). Some states may require additional local NOCs." },
        { question: "Are all plastics recyclable?", answer: "No. Recyclable plastics include PET, HDPE, PP, LDPE, PS, and PVC. Non-recyclable or difficult-to-recycle plastics include thermoset plastics, Styrofoam, multilayer laminated plastics, polyurethane foam (PUF), Bakelite, Melamine, Nylon, and bioplastics/composite materials." },
        { question: "What is the land area required for plastic waste recycling plant setup?", answer: "Generally, approximately 700-800 sq. ft. of land is required for a small-scale plastic waste recycling plant. Larger operations handling 5+ MT/day require 2,500-5,000 sq. ft. including processing, storage, workers' facilities, and pollution control areas." },
        { question: "Is there any government subsidy for plastic waste recycling plant setup?", answer: "Yes. The MSME Ministry offers subsidies for green technology adoption including plastic recycling. Under schemes like PMEGP, MSMEs can avail 15-35% capital subsidy. State governments and PCBs also offer additional incentives for certified plastic waste recycling units in India." },
        { question: "What is the process for plastic recycling machine factory setup?", answer: "The process involves: market research and business plan, site selection and zoning clearance, obtaining Consent to Establish (CTE) from SPCB, installing machinery and pollution control, trial run, obtaining Consent to Operate (CTO), factory license, PWP registration on CPCB EPR portal, and starting operations + generating EPR credits." }
