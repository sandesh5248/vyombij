This means physically collecting end-of-life electronic equipment from consumers and channeling it to authorized dismantlers and recyclers.",
                            "Under the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2022, producers are required to set up take-back systems for their products after they reach end-of-life. The collection, transportation, dismantling, and recycling of e-waste must be done exclusively through CPCB/SPCB-authorized channels.",
