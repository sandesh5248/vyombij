                            Carbon black is a fine black powder produced by the incomplete combustion of heavy petroleum products such as coal tar, ethylene cracking tar, or FCC tar. It is widely used as a reinforcing agent in tyres and rubber products and as a pigment in inks, plastics, and coatings.
                        </p>
                        <p className="text-[17px] text-slate-600 leading-relaxed font-medium mb-6">
                            Due to its industrial importance, carbon black production is considered a regulated manufacturing activity in India. Businesses must comply with environmental laws, factory regulations, and pollution control norms before starting operations.
                        </p>
                        <p className="text-[17px] text-slate-600 leading-relaxed font-medium mb-6">
                            When entrepreneurs set up such manufacturing facilities, they often rely on professional support to ensure all legal approvals and registrations are completed smoothly. Businesses choosing Vyombiz managed by Clink Consultancy Services Private Limited benefit from structured compliance assistance, documentation support, and regulatory guidance required for industrial setup.
