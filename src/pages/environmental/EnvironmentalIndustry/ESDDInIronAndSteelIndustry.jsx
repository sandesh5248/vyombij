                            question: "Why is the Iron & Steel industry subject to such intense Environmental Due Diligence?",
                            answer: "The steel sector is one of the highest industrial contributors to national carbon emissions. It consumes massive volumes of raw materials (iron ore, coal) and water, while generating immense quantities of toxic air emissions, contaminated wastewater (containing cyanides and heavy metals), and solid slag. This immense ecological footprint requires constant, intense regulatory scrutiny."

                            question: "What specific air emissions does an ESDD cover in a steel plant?",
                            answer: "The audit rigorously evaluates both primary emissions from stacks (chimneys) and secondary 'fugitive' emissions from raw material handling. Key parameters include Particulate Matter (PM), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and highly toxic Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) originating primarily from coke oven batteries."

                            question: "How does ESDD address the massive solid waste generated by steel production?",
                            answer: "A major focus is ensuring the plant operates on circular economy principles. The audit verifies if Blast Furnace Slag and Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) slag are being properly managed, granulated, and sold to cement manufacturers rather than being illegally dumped. We also audit the disposal of hazardous wastes like ETP sludge and tar."

                            answer: "Social due diligence evaluates Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) given the extreme temperatures and hazardous nature of the work. It checks safety records, usage of PPE, and worker training. It also looks outward, assessing the plant's impact on neighboring communities (noise, dust, water depletion) and the execution of mandatory Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) projects."

                            question: "How does an ESDD audit handle water consumption in a steel plant?",
                            answer: "Steel production is incredibly water-intensive (used for cooling and cleaning). ESDD audits the specific water consumption per ton of steel produced, verifies compliance with Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) extraction limits, and assesses the facility's progress toward achieving Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) through robust wastewater recycling capabilities."

                            question: "Is ESDD required before acquiring an existing steel plant (M&A)?",
                            answer: "Absolutely. When acquiring a legacy steel plant, the buyer inherits all past sins. An ESDD uncovers hidden liabilities like contaminated groundwater plumes, unlined hazardous waste dumps, pending litigations from local villagers, or expired environmental clearances that could cost the acquirer millions in retroactive fines."
                        },
                        {
                            question: "What happens if a steel plant fails the ESDD audit?",
                            answer: "Corpbiz categorizes findings into risk tiers. High-risk non-compliances (like failing ETPs or lack of valid CTOs) are red-flagged. We immediately draft an Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP), working with plant management and our legal teams to swiftly implement technological upgrades or file necessary regulatory paperwork to restore compliance."

                            question: "Can an ESDD report help a steel manufacturer secure green funding?",
                            answer: "Yes. Global financial institutions are increasingly unwilling to fund heavily polluting 'brown' assets without proof of a transition plan. A verified ESDD report that outlines a clear, actionable decarbonization strategy (like transitioning from blast furnaces to Electric Arc Furnaces powered by renewables) is essential to unlock Transition Finance and Green Loans."
