The EPR authorization is mandated for the producers, importers, manufacturers, and brand owners.",
                            "EPR is a practice that encompasses a combination of environmental, economic, and social factors. EPR is a policy strategy in which producers are held financially and physically responsible for the handling and disposal of post-consumer items.",

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is mandated to grant, renew or refuse Extended Producers Responsibility (EPR) authorization as per Rule 13(1) of E-Waste Rules 2016.",

It mandates them to take responsibility for the end-of-life management of their products."

                    "question": "What is the RoHS compliance requirement under e-waste EPR?",
                    "answer": "Producers must ensure their EEE products comply with RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) standards — limiting hazardous substances like lead, mercury, cadmium, and chromium. A self-declaration of RoHS compliance must be submitted with the EPR application."
          },
          {
                    "question": "How is the e-waste collection target calculated?",
                    "answer": "The target is 60% of the quantity of EEE products placed in the market in year Y-X (where X is the average life of the product). For example, if a TV has a 5-year life and you sold 10,000 units in 2018–19, your 2023–24 target is 60% of 10,000 = 6,000 units to collect."

                    "question": "Can a producer outsource EPR target fulfilment to a PRO?",
                    "answer": "Yes. Producers can engage a CPCB-registered PRO to manage all e-waste collection activities on their behalf. The PRO organizes collection logistics, take-back programs, and reporting. However, the producer remains legally responsible for compliance on the CPCB portal."

                    "answer": "Selling EEE products in India without valid EPR authorization is a violation of the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2022. This can result in Environmental Compensation, court orders, product recall by regulatory authorities, and reputational damage."
