                            The simplest and most common form of business structure in India, owned, managed and operated by one person, is called Sole Proprietorship. Also known as solo entrepreneurship, proprietorship, or lone tradership, it is an ideal choice for small businesses and solo entrepreneurs. A sole proprietorship registration is a recommended type by entrepreneurs who want complete control over their business. While such businesses can employ others to work for them, a sole proprietorship is not recognized as a separate legal entity.
                        </p>

                        <p className="text-[17px] text-slate-600 leading-relaxed font-medium mb-6">
                            There is no legal difference between the business and its owner, making the owner wholly responsible for the profits, debts and business liabilities. Unlike other business forms, sole proprietorship does not mandate formal business registration with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA). However, obtaining a Shop and Establishment Act License, GST registration and other permits essential to the business for legal operations is critical.
