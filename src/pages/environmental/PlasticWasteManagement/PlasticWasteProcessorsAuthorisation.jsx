        { question: "What is Plastic Waste Processors Authorisation?", answer: "Plastic Waste Processors Authorisation (PWP Authorisation) is a mandatory certificate issued by the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) or Pollution Control Committee (PCC) to entities that collect, segregate, recycle, process (waste-to-energy, waste-to-oil, co-processing), and dispose of plastic waste. It is required under the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016 and its amendments." },
        { question: "Who needs to obtain PWP Authorisation?", answer: "All entities involved in collection, segregate, transport, processing, recycling, or disposal of plastic waste must obtain PWP Authorisation. This includes recyclers, waste-to-energy and waste-to-oil units, industrial composting units, co-processing facilities, and end-of-life plastic disposal firms operating in India." },
        { question: "What is the validity of PWP Authorisation?", answer: "PWP Authorisation is typically valid for 5 years from the date of issue, subject to the conditions prescribed by the SPCB/PCC. Renewal must be applied for at least 60 days before the expiry of the existing authorisation." },
        { question: "What is the role of PWP Authorisation in the EPR framework?", answer: "PWP-authorised recyclers are the only entities allowed to generate EPR processing certificates on the CPCB centralized portal. These certificates are purchased by PIBOs (producers, importers, brand owners) to fulfil their annual EPR plastic recycling targets. Without PWP Authorisation, a recycler cannot participate in the EPR credit market." },
        { question: "What are the key compliances for an authorised PWP?", answer: "Key post-authorisation obligations include: maintaining records of plastic waste received and processed, filing annual returns on the CPCB centralized EPR portal by June 30 (or April 30 for some categories), generating and transacting EPR certificates for all plastic waste processed, and submitting half-yearly returns to SPCB as per the authorisation conditions." },
        { question: "Can an MSME get PWP Authorisation?", answer: "Yes. MSMEs engaged in plastic waste processing can obtain PWP Authorisation. The procedure is the same as for larger entities, though some state PCBs offer expedited processing for MSME applicants. Corpbiz has assisted hundreds of MSME recyclers in obtaining PWP Authorisation across India." },
        { question: "What is the difference between Consent to Operate (CTO) and PWP Authorisation?", answer: "Consent to Operate (CTO) is granted by the SPCB under the Air and Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Acts for operating a processing facility. PWP Authorisation is specifically granted under the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016 for processing plastic waste. Both are required for operating a compliant plastic waste processing facility." }
